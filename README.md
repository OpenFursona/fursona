# fursona

Let's create the best possible fursona. In order to do this, we need to decide on things like species, physical characteristics, and colors and markings.

While PRs should be automatically merged, please note GitHub's rule reguarding sexually obscene content. If this becomes an issue, there will be manual intervention.

> Basically, don't post pornography. This does not mean that all nudity or sexual content is prohibited. We recognize that sexuality is a part of life and non-pornographic sexual content may be a part of your project, or may be presented for educational or artistic purposes.

If this doesn't go horribly, we might be able to try and find an artist to draw the result.

## species

Nonbinary sergal


## backstory
- they/she pronouns
- their intimidating grin will send chills down anyone's spine
- master of manipulation, and ruler of all (or so they'd like to think)
- listens to surf rock and dark techno, but also secretly loves cheesy folk songs. 

## physical characteristics
- very tall
- lanky and frail, as if they aren't eating enough
- only walks on their toes, and never wears shoes
- tattered clothing, but intentionally so. they know a thing or two about fashion.
- has a couple piercings

## markings and colors

Velvety grey fur with a lavender trim that starts at the tip of the nose and trails down over the sides. The lavender is vaguely iridescent.
